Even though FCFS has higher total and average tracks swept, it delivers the faster average turnaround time.  The algorithm with the least variation appears to be SSTN, with CSCAN close behind.  I really wish my code worked so I can give an accurate assessment of SCAN, but from looking at the differences between the two, I would speculate that it would be the most even between tracks swept, the averate of tracks swept, and turnaround time.
